# Comparing-North-American-Breeding-Bird-Databses

## This repository contains data and code used to compare diversity measurements of breeding birds in North America: 

### Using two citizen science datasets, the breeding bird survey (BBS) and breeding bird atlases (BBA)
### This code was used for a paper titled *North American Breeding Bird Survey underestimates regional bird richness compared to Breeding Bird Atlases*
